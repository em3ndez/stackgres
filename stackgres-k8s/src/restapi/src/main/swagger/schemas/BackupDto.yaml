          Metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create.
        properties:
          namespace:
            type: string
            description: |
              Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.

            type: string
            description: |
              Unique in time and space value for the object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations. Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids
