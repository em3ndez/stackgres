description: Details about how to upgrade the database node of a distributed logs.
---

It's possible to upgrade the database nodes of a distributed logs cluster (`SGDistributedLogs`).
This may be required after upgrading the StackGres operator to a newer version.

We can query the `PendingRestart` cluster condition for a distributed logs resource as follows:

```
kubectl get sgdistributedlogs.stackgres.io -A --template '
{{- range $item := .items }}
  {{- range $item.status.conditions }}
    {{- if eq .type "PendingRestart" }}
      {{- printf "%s.%s %s=%s\n" $item.metadata.namespace $item.metadata.name .type .status }}
    {{- end }}
  {{- end }}
{{- end }}'
```

> **Important:** The upgrade procedure will generate a service disruption.
> The service disruption will end when Patroni elects the new primary instance.

The procedure includes some shell script snippet examples.
In those snippet we assume the following environment variables are set with values of the StackGres cluster that you want to restart:

```
NAMESPACE=default
DISTRIBUTED_LOGS_NAME=example
```

## Change the Operator Version Annotation

Change the `SGDistributedLogs` to indicate to use the new operator version.

```
OPERATOR_VERSION="$(helm list -o json -n stackgres \
  | jq -r '.[]|select(.name == "stackgres-operator").app_version')"
kubectl annotate sgdistributedlogs.stackgres.io -n "$NAMESPACE" "$DISTRIBUTED_LOGS_NAME" \
  --overwrite "stackgres.io/operatorVersion=$OPERATOR_VERSION"
```

## Delete the StatefulSet

Delete the stateful set as follows:

```
kubectl delete sts -n "$NAMESPACE" "$DISTRIBUTED_LOGS_NAME" --wait=true
```

## Wait for the Primary to Be Recreated

Wait until the new instance is created and operational, receiving traffic from the service.
This new primary has already been initialized with the new components.

```
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready -n "$NAMESPACE" "pod/$DISTRIBUTED_LOGS_NAME-0"
```
