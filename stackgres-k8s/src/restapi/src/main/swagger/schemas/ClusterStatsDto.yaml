            description: |
              Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
          namespace:
            type: string
            description: |
              Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.

          uid:
            type: string
            description: |
              UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations. Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

                  * **Unavailable**: The instance hold by this pod is unavailable.
                  * **Pending**: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the container images has not been created. This includes time before being scheduled as well as time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while.
                  * **Failed**: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system.
                  * **Unknown**: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod.
