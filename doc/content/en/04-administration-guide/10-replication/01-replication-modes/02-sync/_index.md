The `replication.mode` *sync* option instructs to create one or more cluster members as synchronous replicas. As indicated in the [CRD reference]({{% relref "06-crd-reference/01-sgcluster/#sgclusterspecreplication" %}}) the cluster will not block transactions in the leader in the event of replica lost, since Patroni will turn off the synchronous replication.

## Setting up a Cluster with Synchronous replica

Lets move forward to the next step by creating a synchronous replication cluster:

```yaml
$ cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGCluster
metadata:
  namespace: failover
  name: sync-cluster
spec:
  postgres:
	version: '16.1'
  instances: 3
  sgInstanceProfile: 'size-s'
  pods:
	persistentVolume:
  	size: '10Gi'
  configurations:
	sgPostgresConfig: 'pgconfig1'
	sgPoolingConfig: 'poolconfig1'
  prometheusAutobind: true
  nonProductionOptions:
	disableClusterPodAntiAffinity: true
  replication:
	mode: sync
	role: ha-read
	syncInstances: 1
EOF
```

Since syncInstances is set to 1, one synchronous replica and one asynchronous replica are created accordingly.

```sh
$ kubectl -n failover exec -it sync-cluster-0 -c patroni -- bash - patronictl list
+ Cluster: sync-cluster (7369946595341132525) -----+-----------+----+-----------+
